## Conclusions
# Driving Factors :

The analysis of the loan dataset reveals five key driving variables:

1. Home Ownership: The majority of loan applicants have home ownership of 'RENT' (47.58%). Most of the defaulters(Charged Off) belong to the Rent home ownership category.
2. Loan Purpose: Most of the defaulters(Charged Off) belong to the Debt consolidation loan purpose category.
3. Loan Term: The majority of loans have a term of 36 months (73.3%). Most of the defaulters(Charged Off) belong to the 36 month loan term.
4. Loan Amount: The loan amounts range from $500 to $35,000 with a mean of $11,219 and a median of $10,000. The mean and max loan amounts are highest for 'Charged Off'(Defaulter) loans.
5. Work Experience: The majority of loan applicants have work experience of 10+ years (22.36%).
6. Loan Grade: The majority of loans are assigned a grade of 'B' (29.2%). Most of the defaulters(Charged Off) belong to the 'C' loan grade category.
